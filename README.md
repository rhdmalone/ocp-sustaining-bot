## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openshift-sustaining/ocp-sustaining-bot.git
cd ocp-sustaining-bot

```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Slack and cloud credentials you received from admin:

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-slack-bot-token
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-slack-app-token

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2

OS_AUTH_URL=https://your-openstack-auth-url
OS_PROJECT_NAME=your-openstack-project-name
.
.
.
```

### 5. Run the Bot

4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch)
5. Create a new Pull Request

## Testing
1. There is a slack bot namely : ocp-sustaining-bot is already created and whose credentials will be shared with you along with other cloud credentials.
2. There is a testing slack workspace created : slackbot-template.slack.com . Please get added your user/mail to this by admin.
3. Make sure you add your local .env file with all secrets to the repo root.
4. Once you have your code changes ready the run the code locally using `python slack_main.py` 
5. Then from the slackbot template workspace run your command by mention or direct message to test.

## TBD 
1. We need to raise a slack addon enablement service now ticket (https://redhat.service-now.com/help?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=35bfc06313b82a00dce03ff18144b0d2 ) for this bot to be added to our workspace.
2. Once we are ready with basic commands we can deploy this to our server / or any redhat platform where we run production workloads.  Then ppl can start using this on redhat workspace. 
3. We need to limit this bot our user group which is not done yet.
4. We need to create a build ,test , deploy pipeline to prod for automating new change deployment. Will use github actions.
